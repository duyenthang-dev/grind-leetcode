# Road to Grind Leetcode ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to my journey of "Grind" LeetCode problems through consistent practice.
All solutions are written in Java 17. Many of them are not optimized solutions; just use them as a reference

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s inside?
âœ… Solutions to LeetCode problems (categorized by difficulty & pattern)
âœ… Better solutions with explanations from other Leetcoders (if available)
âœ… Notes on key concepts and problem-solving strategies
âœ… Continuous updates as I solve more challenges

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To improve problem-solving skills, strengthen my DSA knowledge, and prepare for technical interviews. ðŸ’ªðŸš€
